	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>This flavorful, jazzed-up egg salad is part of a favorite meal of William Phelps, executive chef at Caf√© Manna,
		one he would happily enjoy with abandon on a day when calories don't count. He likes his egg salad on Danish
		rye, toasted, and a bit of butter.</p>
	<p>When I think of Egg Salad sandwich I always think about bridal shower, baby showers, spring time and Easter. All
		the great events that are bright and loving that bring everyone together. I love the simplicity of this classic Egg
		Salad Sandwich with only a few ingredients. Boiled eggs, mayonnaise, a touch of a mustard and elegant toppings with
		dill and chives to add that extra touch of perfection. This literally is the BEST Egg Salad Sandwich that is easy to
		make, little to few ingredients and a delicious taste that is satisfying and can feed a crowd.</p>
